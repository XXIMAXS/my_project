<h1>The most prominent among them was, of course, the highly respected detective Hercule Poirot,
    who ended up in this company completely by chance. It was he who announced the unpleasant news that shocked everyone.
    A corpse was found. It is obvious that a person has been killed, and the real killer is among the respected passengers.
    Naturally, no one has the right to leave the express until the circumstances have been clarified, as well as the alibi
    has been confirmed. The great detective is back on the case.</h1>
