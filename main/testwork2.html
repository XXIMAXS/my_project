<h1>The train left on time. Ladies and gentlemen took their seats and got ready for a long trip around Europe.
    The audience was the most diverse. A luxurious widow, vainly trying to hide the flirtatious gaze directed at all free men.
    The elderly princess arrogantly surveyed the restaurant's visitors.
    The fussy secretary and the timid governess tried to be inconspicuous.
