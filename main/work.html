        <h1>The Nun</h1>
        <h2>In the movie "Nun", a remote monastery in Romania is stunned by the suicide of a young nun, after which two people are sent there to find out the reasons for the girl's death and investigate the case. The church officials do not understand how a man who dedicated himself to God could commit such a sin, so a priest with a murky past and a novice go to this God-forsaken place to find out what really happened. A terrible and terrible secret, which the walls of this monastery keep, will be revealed to them. After all, the local church is in the power of a terrible evil that kills people. The demonic essence subjugates people to itself, mastering their will. All this is happening in order to make a ritual of reincarnation of the devil himself. The deceased girl has turned into an instrument of demonic power, which needs new victims. Now it will kill mercilessly, and only the priest and the novice will be able to put an end to the bloody murders in the monastery. Will they be able to fight the demonic entity that roams the old monastery and stay alive?</h2>
